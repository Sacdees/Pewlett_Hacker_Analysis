# Pewlett_Hacker_Analysis
## Project Overview 

The company commissioned to help identify and perform analysis for future-proofing the company by determining how many people will be retiring and, of those employees, who is eligible for a retirement package. Further we were able to compile information for employees that may be able to facilatate replacing those retirees 


## Results

The first part of the project was to locate the existing employees that are ready for retirement.  Upon first look we were able to query a result depicted by the image below, more detailed information can be found in the data file under 'retirement_titles', but as you see at first look this initial request leaves a lot of duplicate data that can clog up and use too much space for our client.

Below you can find that we elimated duplicate entries.  As you may expect many of the employees that could retire, have probably also held multiple positions within the company.  This unique_titles query lists the employees by their final position and can then be categorized more effectively.

In an effort to assist with further planning of a retirement boom, we categorized the titles for each segment to get an idea of how many potential employees will be elgible and or retirement eliglble per department.

We were also able to produce some data for potential mentorship candidates.  With the high level of retirement eligeble canidates, it is very important to stay ahead of the curve and the image below depicts the potential employees that can replace those positions.
